feature engineering:
f:(house length, house width) = house price ---feature engineering---> f:(house area) = house price
house length and width can be multiplied into house area as a single feature
this helps in computational efficiency and accuracy

feature selection:
choosing the most relevant features helps in reducing overfitting and improving computational efficiency

addressing overfitting:
1. train on more data (looking at more data will help the model generalize better)
2. feature selection
3. regularization

regularization:
limit parameter sizes
suppose a model uses w4x^4 + w3x^3 + w2x^2 + w1x + b
one way to reduce overfit due to large w4 and w3 values is to set model as 1000w4 + 1000w3 + w2x^2 + w1x + b
this way automatically w4 and w3 are minimized since otherwise cost would be large
