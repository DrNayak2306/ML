# The 7 steps of machine learning
## 1. Gathering data
## 2. Preparing that data
## 3. Choosing a model
Visualization methods like pair plotting helps determine the right model, which saves a lot of compute and effort in hyperparameter tuning.
## 4. Training
## 5. Evaluation
## 6. Hyperparameter Tuning
Domain specific expertise involved and is more artisanal in nature.
## 7. Prediction

# Data preprocessing
## Data cleaning
* Removing duplicates
* Handling missing values 
* Correcting inconsistent formats
## Data integration
* Schema matching
* Data deduplication
## Data transformation
* Scaling
* Encoding
* Feature engineering
## Data reduction
* Sampling
* Feature selection
* Dimensionality reduction
